The Greek word ""ΦΙΛΟΞΕΝΙΑ=hospitality"" is of a particular importance in the Greek culture. It’s a compound word from ""ΦΙΛΩ=LOVE"" and ""ΞΕΝΟΣ=GUEST "" and refers to the act of nestling and caring of a guest by the host. It was an institution for the ancient Greeks to welcome and take care of the guests at their home. They believed particularly in the idea of hospitality and regarded it as a moral duty and a sacred rule of the gods (Xenios Zeus was the protector of the guests). They offered them bath and sleep and they greeted them with gifts. The host and the guest were linked with friendly ties, which where inherited to their descendants. 
This is our inheritance.

I am Stratos Zafeiriadis

I am a husband, a father of a 3yrs old child, a host, an nocarz Community Leader in the capital of Greece, an Experience maker and a property manager in Greece (“where else” lol). 

I love Greece, its outstanding beauty and I have a dream:  to transmit to all my guests the hidden charm and all the secrets of my beloved country starting from A to Z. That’s why i am established from Athens to Zakynthos

During the summer I move to Zakynthos and here I like to express all my devotion for my island. I have created the Zante Free Walking Tour in order to widespread the beauty and history of my place. I really love this activity and I look forward to show it to you in one of the most beautiful places in the world! I’m not here to propose you just a nice accommodation. 

I always try to make your trip a lifetime memory. That’s why I could advise you places (secret or not) you will never been, places you will never imagine that exist! 

In Zakynthos also I run our family properties Alta Mare Villa Zakynthos and Alta Mare City View Luxury Apt (our new project).

During winter I move to Athens where I am proud to be the nocarz Community Leader of Athens and Attica Region.

I’d love to answer your questions and share with you my favorite spots of Athens and Zakynthos, the places where I actually live and love

At Gaia, we encourage our guests to enjoy what the real Greece has to offer and we want to show you that the local way is the only way!

Being Greek, family and hospitality is deeply rooted within our culture, and is at the heart of everything we do here at Gaia. We want our guests to feel right at home in our wonderful city, and however long your stay, we promise to make it a truly enjoyable authentic Greek experience; come and discover what it means to live the local way!

Guests’ safety and comfort is at the top of our list, and we strive to make sure your stay at Gaia meets all your needs as a home from home - we are proud this summer to offer our guests newly renovated rooms, with optimum comfort in mind. I learnt from a young age the value of hospitality and I understand how important it is to feel at home, more than ever when you are away. Growing up with and working in hospitality, I was inspired by my love of meeting new people, making connections, and most of all, helping these people get the most out of their experiences - so much so, that I have formed a career around the business of making this happen! We want to make sure guests don’t just have a place to stay, but gain as much as they can from their visit to Athens! People come from all parts of the world to visit our amazing city as their chosen holiday destination - it’s my job (and my pleasure!) to help make their experience the best it can possibly be!

Athens to me is home; the people, the kindness shown within the community and to strangers alike - we have an amazing atmosphere here, and it’s one you won’t find anywhere else in the world. Here in Athens we like to have fun, we delight in the old and embrace the new - which you’ll see wherever you walk within the city - the beautiful meeting of Modern and Ancient Greece. A city that has it all, everything for everyone - and so much more than a visit to the Acropolis! I want to share this special connection I have with the city with others, and encourage visitors, both Greek and international, to explore the place I’m proud to call home. Let me show you my Athens! 

Psirri in particular, is the buzzing neighbourhood where you’ll find us (along with the best hangouts and eateries in Athens!) - the Gaia family is proud to be part of a community that represents the very soul of the city. Experience real Greece here; eat what the locals do, drink with us, explore our streets you haven’t read about yet, take a walk through our history, modern and ancient - and live the local way!

Since my family and I began constructing Gaia in 2016, we have worked hard to expand, and are now able to offer more options for our guests seeking independent accommodation within the heart of the city. With our guests’ needs in mind, we’re now managing premium apartments, in the perfect location, which capture the authenticity and spirit of Psyri; you’ll be able to experience the real Athens like a local, with all the amenities you need to feel at home.
 
Gaia was created by family for family - since we started out as a small hotel with only a few rooms open, people have loved staying with us because of our incredible culture of going above and beyond when it comes to hospitality - my family has always lived by this principle, and we welcome all of our guests as we do our own family - we’ll make sure you won’t leave Athens without a full stomach, a story to tell and a promise to come back and visit! We look forward to welcoming you soon!

we are Lila and George and we are looking forward hosting you! 
I (Lila)  am   a software engineer whereas George teaches  ancient Greek in high school. I adore  jazz,  mystery novels, interior design and of course travels.
(my favorite  jazz artists are Louis Armstrong, Art Tatum, Miles Davis, Stephan Grappelli and my favorite mystery authors are  George Simenon and Andrea Camilleri ). I dream to visit Prague, Bergen, NY, Egypt, St.Petersburg, Cuba, Peking and many other places....
George loves Plato,Socrates, Maria Callas, Nana Mouskouri and the french singer Dalida. He dreams to visit Egypt, St.Petersburg, Ethiopia, Peru and the Greek island of Milos !!
We all adore home made pizza!  When our kids were young we used to prepare it    every Sunday.  It was and remains our family's ritual !
When we travel as a family,  we are looking  for  a warm ambiance, amenities to live (and eat) on a budget, BUT without any compromises in the elegance and style. Quite difficult!
So, we are  happy that nocarz came into the scene and  we are glad to offer other  families (or couples, or friends )  what we would like to enjoy during our  travels abroad. The reviews we got, up to now,  show  that we have achieved this goal! It would be nice to meet you guys !

Athens has morphed into southern Europe’s capital of cool. Long weekenders are swooping in to check out the exciting food scene and check into the new wave of cool hotels in Athens. Artists and designers are settling in for good, lured by affordable rents, the promise of sunshine, and an anarchic spirit where you don’t have to play by the rules. There’s nothing orderly about Athens: traffic is chaotic, life is messy, the architecture a mash-up of Byzantine and Bauhaus, neoclassical and nondescript. The Parthenon still dominates the skyline – and will forever be one of the key things to do in Athens – but for most Athenians the antiquities embedded among tightly packed apartment blocks are an afterthought.

At Gaia, we encourage our guests to enjoy what the real Greece has to offer and we want to show you that the local way is the only way!

Being Greek, family and hospitality is deeply rooted within our culture, and is at the heart of everything we do here at Gaia. We want our guests to feel right at home in our wonderful city, and however long your stay, we promise to make it a truly enjoyable authentic Greek experience; come and discover what it means to live the local way!

Guests’ safety and comfort is at the top of our list, and we strive to make sure your stay at Gaia meets all your needs as a home from home - we are proud this summer to offer our guests newly renovated rooms, with optimum comfort in mind. I learnt from a young age the value of hospitality and I understand how important it is to feel at home, more than ever when you are away. Growing up with and working in hospitality, I was inspired by my love of meeting new people, making connections, and most of all, helping these people get the most out of their experiences - so much so, that I have formed a career around the business of making this happen! We want to make sure guests don’t just have a place to stay, but gain as much as they can from their visit to Athens! People come from all parts of the world to visit our amazing city as their chosen holiday destination - it’s my job (and my pleasure!) to help make their experience the best it can possibly be!

Athens to me is home; the people, the kindness shown within the community and to strangers alike - we have an amazing atmosphere here, and it’s one you won’t find anywhere else in the world. Here in Athens we like to have fun, we delight in the old and embrace the new - which you’ll see wherever you walk within the city - the beautiful meeting of Modern and Ancient Greece. A city that has it all, everything for everyone - and so much more than a visit to the Acropolis! I want to share this special connection I have with the city with others, and encourage visitors, both Greek and international, to explore the place I’m proud to call home. Let me show you my Athens! 

Psirri in particular, is the buzzing neighbourhood where you’ll find us (along with the best hangouts and eateries in Athens!) - the Gaia family is proud to be part of a community that represents the very soul of the city. Experience real Greece here; eat what the locals do, drink with us, explore our streets you haven’t read about yet, take a walk through our history, modern and ancient - and live the local way!

Since my family and I began constructing Gaia in 2016, we have worked hard to expand, and are now able to offer more options for our guests seeking independent accommodation within the heart of the city. With our guests’ needs in mind, we’re now managing premium apartments, in the perfect location, which capture the authenticity and spirit of Psyri; you’ll be able to experience the real Athens like a local, with all the amenities you need to feel at home.
 
Gaia was created by family for family - since we started out as a small hotel with only a few rooms open, people have loved staying with us because of our incredible culture of going above and beyond when it comes to hospitality - my family has always lived by this principle, and we welcome all of our guests as we do our own family - we’ll make sure you won’t leave Athens without a full stomach, a story to tell and a promise to come back and visit! We look forward to welcoming you soon!

The final shaping of the façade was supervised by Ernest Ziller, who was responsible until 1889, when the western wing was completed.

I am Stella "" happy traveler"" for the last forty years. We decided to do something that we love very much, through nocarz.
The Greek word ""ΦΙΛΟΞΕΝΙΑ=hospitality"" is of particular importance in the Greek culture. It’s a compound word from ""ΦΙΛΩ=LOVE"" and ""ΞΕΝΟΣ=GUEST "" and refers to the act of nesting and caring for a guest by the host. It was an institution for the ancient Greeks to welcome and take care of the guests at their home. They believed particularly in the idea of hospitality and regarded it as a moral duty and a sacred rule of the gods (Xenios Zeus was the protector of the guests). They offered them bath and sleep and they greeted them with gifts. The host and the guest were linked with friendly ties, which where inherited to their descendants.
This is our inheritance!

At Gaia, we encourage our guests to enjoy what the real Greece has to offer and we want to show you that the local way is the only way!

Being Greek, family and hospitality is deeply rooted within our culture, and is at the heart of everything we do here at Gaia. We want our guests to feel right at home in our wonderful city, and however long your stay, we promise to make it a truly enjoyable authentic Greek experience; come and discover what it means to live the local way!

Guests’ safety and comfort is at the top of our list, and we strive to make sure your stay at Gaia meets all your needs as a home from home - we are proud this summer to offer our guests newly renovated rooms, with optimum comfort in mind. I learnt from a young age the value of hospitality and I understand how important it is to feel at home, more than ever when you are away. Growing up with and working in hospitality, I was inspired by my love of meeting new people, making connections, and most of all, helping these people get the most out of their experiences - so much so, that I have formed a career around the business of making this happen! We want to make sure guests don’t just have a place to stay, but gain as much as they can from their visit to Athens! People come from all parts of the world to visit our amazing city as their chosen holiday destination - it’s my job (and my pleasure!) to help make their experience the best it can possibly be!

Athens to me is home; the people, the kindness shown within the community and to strangers alike - we have an amazing atmosphere here, and it’s one you won’t find anywhere else in the world. Here in Athens we like to have fun, we delight in the old and embrace the new - which you’ll see wherever you walk within the city - the beautiful meeting of Modern and Ancient Greece. A city that has it all, everything for everyone - and so much more than a visit to the Acropolis! I want to share this special connection I have with the city with others, and encourage visitors, both Greek and international, to explore the place I’m proud to call home. Let me show you my Athens! 

Psirri in particular, is the buzzing neighbourhood where you’ll find us (along with the best hangouts and eateries in Athens!) - the Gaia family is proud to be part of a community that represents the very soul of the city. Experience real Greece here; eat what the locals do, drink with us, explore our streets you haven’t read about yet, take a walk through our history, modern and ancient - and live the local way!

Since my family and I began constructing Gaia in 2016, we have worked hard to expand, and are now able to offer more options for our guests seeking independent accommodation within the heart of the city. With our guests’ needs in mind, we’re now managing premium apartments, in the perfect location, which capture the authenticity and spirit of Psyri; you’ll be able to experience the real Athens like a local, with all the amenities you need to feel at home.
 
Gaia was created by family for family - since we started out as a small hotel with only a few rooms open, people have loved staying with us because of our incredible culture of going above and beyond when it comes to hospitality - my family has always lived by this principle, and we welcome all of our guests as we do our own family - we’ll make sure you won’t leave Athens without a full stomach, a story to tell and a promise to come back and visit! We look forward to welcoming you soon!

I really like meeting new people from all over the world while travelling or, even better, having them visit Athens and hosting them! I am energetic and forward-thinking (or so my friends and colleagues say about me), a physical as well as intellectual person. I enjoy football and alternative sports, but also reading good books and of course activities like puzzles and escape rooms, things I do for a living!
I have travelled all over Europe and Africa and I consider Paris and Budapest my favourite destinations, places of history but also modern and cosmopolitan, having many things to see and do.
Films and TV shows about historic events and murder mysteries are my favorite and recently I got infatuated with Money Heist (“La casa de Papel”). while my literature of choice is mainly classic and timeless. I could not imagine myself as I am today without having read “Around the World in 80 Days” in my childhood!
I enjoy Mediterranean and Greek traditional cuisine, but I would like to taste every culinary tradition the world has to offer.

We are Maria & Alex, the founders, both engineers. So we were already working together in the design & construction sector, so we  dealt with properties all the time. We are both into details, both love doing something right from scratch.

While we were traveling to new places and meeting old friends / making new ones, we felt what a rental should feel like, what it should offer guests like ourselves. Lots were missing, especially the simple little things that makes a visitor feel right at home -away from home. We then decided to start a rentals & real estate management company. It was July 2015 and we named it TopHouzzing Properties - the mission was simply to offer truly top accommodation to our guests. Starting then with a couple of our own properties, refurbished completely, we embarked on a great journey. 

Today the company manages close to 100 properties and growing steadily, mostly in Athens but also in mainland Greece and islands, flats, villas and so on. TopHouzzing  also offers consulting & real estate, design & construction and other professional services in its portfolio.

Hard work and our passion paid off. Our success is clearly stated not only in the many owners that trust us with their properties but even more in the hundreds 5-star reviews from guests from all over the world,  leading us to have a record of 14 consecutive quarters-since the company’s inception- SuperHost status on nocarz!

We take very good care of our guests and so do we with owners. You see, we both think as guests & owners ourselves.

At Gaia, we encourage our guests to enjoy what the real Greece has to offer and we want to show you that the local way is the only way!

Being Greek, family and hospitality is deeply rooted within our culture, and is at the heart of everything we do here at Gaia. We want our guests to feel right at home in our wonderful city, and however long your stay, we promise to make it a truly enjoyable authentic Greek experience; come and discover what it means to live the local way!

Guests’ safety and comfort is at the top of our list, and we strive to make sure your stay at Gaia meets all your needs as a home from home - we are proud this summer to offer our guests newly renovated rooms, with optimum comfort in mind. I learnt from a young age the value of hospitality and I understand how important it is to feel at home, more than ever when you are away. Growing up with and working in hospitality, I was inspired by my love of meeting new people, making connections, and most of all, helping these people get the most out of their experiences - so much so, that I have formed a career around the business of making this happen! We want to make sure guests don’t just have a place to stay, but gain as much as they can from their visit to Athens! People come from all parts of the world to visit our amazing city as their chosen holiday destination - it’s my job (and my pleasure!) to help make their experience the best it can possibly be!

Athens to me is home; the people, the kindness shown within the community and to strangers alike - we have an amazing atmosphere here, and it’s one you won’t find anywhere else in the world. Here in Athens we like to have fun, we delight in the old and embrace the new - which you’ll see wherever you walk within the city - the beautiful meeting of Modern and Ancient Greece. A city that has it all, everything for everyone - and so much more than a visit to the Acropolis! I want to share this special connection I have with the city with others, and encourage visitors, both Greek and international, to explore the place I’m proud to call home. Let me show you my Athens! 

Psirri in particular, is the buzzing neighbourhood where you’ll find us (along with the best hangouts and eateries in Athens!) - the Gaia family is proud to be part of a community that represents the very soul of the city. Experience real Greece here; eat what the locals do, drink with us, explore our streets you haven’t read about yet, take a walk through our history, modern and ancient - and live the local way!

Since my family and I began constructing Gaia in 2016, we have worked hard to expand, and are now able to offer more options for our guests seeking independent accommodation within the heart of the city. With our guests’ needs in mind, we’re now managing premium apartments, in the perfect location, which capture the authenticity and spirit of Psyri; you’ll be able to experience the real Athens like a local, with all the amenities you need to feel at home.
 
Gaia was created by family for family - since we started out as a small hotel with only a few rooms open, people have loved staying with us because of our incredible culture of going above and beyond when it comes to hospitality - my family has always lived by this principle, and we welcome all of our guests as we do our own family - we’ll make sure you won’t leave Athens without a full stomach, a story to tell and a promise to come back and visit! We look forward to welcoming you soon!

I am Alexandros, an ex-financier who turned into an entrepreneur.

I grew up in Athens, Greece, an awesome and vibrant city, where I studied Civil Engineering at NTUA. I was always keen on music, a passion which I flipped into DJing, yeap!!! Following my graduation I wanted to see the world and study abroad, so I attended Columbia University in NYC for my second Masters degree. The 2008 crash sent me directly to Germany where I started my career in banking.

After some years in corporate environments I decided to follow my real love, which is creating things from scratch, so I quit my job and alongside with my brother, George, we began a hospitality start-up.

We provide unique furnished apartments by offering personalized services!

It is so awesome to be an explorer and we believe that if you do not travel is like reading only the cover of the book. Hence,  t-r-a-v-e-l  :)

Growing up with and working in hospitality, I was inspired by my love of meeting new people, making connections, and most of all, helping these people get the most out of their experiences - so much so, that I have formed a career around the business of making this happen! We want to make sure guests don’t just have a place to stay, but gain as much as they can from their visit to Athens! People come from all parts of the world to visit our amazing city as their chosen holiday destination - it’s my job (and my pleasure!) to help make their experience the best it can possibly be!

Athens to me is home; the people, the kindness shown within the community and to strangers alike - we have an amazing atmosphere here, and it’s one you won’t find anywhere else in the world. Here in Athens we like to have fun, we delight in the old and embrace the new - which you’ll see wherever you walk within the city - the beautiful meeting of Modern and Ancient Greece. A city that has it all, everything for everyone - and so much more than a visit to the Acropolis! I want to share this special connection I have with the city with others, and encourage visitors, both Greek and international, to explore the place I’m proud to call home. Let me show you my Athens! 

Psirri in particular, is the buzzing neighbourhood where you’ll find us (along with the best hangouts and eateries in Athens!) - the Gaia family is proud to be part of a community that represents the very soul of the city. Experience real Greece here; eat what the locals do, drink with us, explore our streets you haven’t read about yet, take a walk through our history, modern and ancient - and live the local way!

Since my family and I began constructing Gaia in 2016, we have worked hard to expand, and are now able to offer more options for our guests seeking independent accommodation within the heart of the city. With our guests’ needs in mind, we’re now managing premium apartments, in the perfect location, which capture the authenticity and spirit of Psyri; you’ll be able to experience the real Athens like a local, with all the amenities you need to feel at home.
 
Gaia was created by family for family - since we started out as a small hotel with only a few rooms open, people have loved staying with us because of our incredible culture of going above and beyond when it comes to hospitality - my family has always lived by this principle, and we welcome all of our guests as we do our own family - we’ll make sure you won’t leave Athens without a full stomach, a story to tell and a promise to come back and visit! We look forward to welcoming you soon!

At Gaia, we encourage our guests to enjoy what the real Greece has to offer and we want to show you that the local way is the only way!

Being Greek, family and hospitality is deeply rooted within our culture, and is at the heart of everything we do here at Gaia. We want our guests to feel right at home in our wonderful city, and however long your stay, we promise to make it a truly enjoyable authentic Greek experience; come and discover what it means to live the local way!

Guests’ safety and comfort is at the top of our list, and we strive to make sure your stay at Gaia meets all your needs as a home from home - we are proud this summer to offer our guests newly renovated rooms, with optimum comfort in mind. I learnt from a young age the value of hospitality and I understand how important it is to feel at home, more than ever when you are away. Growing up with and working in hospitality, I was inspired by my love of meeting new people, making connections, and most of all, helping these people get the most out of their experiences - so much so, that I have formed a career around the business of making this happen! We want to make sure guests don’t just have a place to stay, but gain as much as they can from their visit to Athens! People come from all parts of the world to visit our amazing city as their chosen holiday destination - it’s my job (and my pleasure!) to help make their experience the best it can possibly be!

Athens to me is home; the people, the kindness shown within the community and to strangers alike - we have an amazing atmosphere here, and it’s one you won’t find anywhere else in the world. Here in Athens we like to have fun, we delight in the old and embrace the new - which you’ll see wherever you walk within the city - the beautiful meeting of Modern and Ancient Greece. A city that has it all, everything for everyone - and so much more than a visit to the Acropolis! I want to share this special connection I have with the city with others, and encourage visitors, both Greek and international, to explore the place I’m proud to call home. Let me show you my Athens! 

Psirri in particular, is the buzzing neighbourhood where you’ll find us (along with the best hangouts and eateries in Athens!) - the Gaia family is proud to be part of a community that represents the very soul of the city. Experience real Greece here; eat what the locals do, drink with us, explore our streets you haven’t read about yet, take a walk through our history, modern and ancient - and live the local way!

Since my family and I began constructing Gaia in 2016, we have worked hard to expand, and are now able to offer more options for our guests seeking independent accommodation within the heart of the city. With our guests’ needs in mind, we’re now managing premium apartments, in the perfect location, which capture the authenticity and spirit of Psyri; you’ll be able to experience the real Athens like a local, with all the amenities you need to feel at home.
 
Gaia was created by family for family - since we started out as a small hotel with only a few rooms open, people have loved staying with us because of our incredible culture of going above and beyond when it comes to hospitality - my family has always lived by this principle, and we welcome all of our guests as we do our own family - we’ll make sure you won’t leave Athens without a full stomach, a story to tell and a promise to come back and visit! We look forward to welcoming you soon!

We are Maria & Alex, the founders, both engineers. So we were already working together in the design & construction sector, so we  dealt with properties all the time. We are both into details, both love doing something right from scratch.

While we were traveling to new places and meeting old friends / making new ones, we felt what a rental should feel like, what it should offer guests like ourselves. Lots were missing, especially the simple little things that makes a visitor feel right at home -away from home. We then decided to start a rentals & real estate management company. It was July 2015 and we named it TopHouzzing Properties - the mission was simply to offer truly top accommodation to our guests. Starting then with a couple of our own properties, refurbished completely, we embarked on a great journey. 

Today the company manages close to 100 properties and growing steadily, mostly in Athens but also in mainland Greece and islands, flats, villas and so on. TopHouzzing  also offers consulting & real estate, design & construction and other professional services in its portfolio.

Hard work and our passion paid off. Our success is clearly stated not only in the many owners that trust us with their properties but even more in the hundreds 5-star reviews from guests from all over the world,  leading us to have a record of 14 consecutive quarters-since the company’s inception- SuperHost status on nocarz!

We are Maria & Alex, the founders, both engineers. So we were already working together in the design & construction sector, so we  dealt with properties all the time. We are both into details, both love doing something right from scratch.

While we were traveling to new places and meeting old friends / making new ones, we felt what a rental should feel like, what it should offer guests like ourselves. Lots were missing, especially the simple little things that makes a visitor feel right at home -away from home. We then decided to start a rentals & real estate management company. It was July 2015 and we named it TopHouzzing Properties - the mission was simply to offer truly top accommodation to our guests. Starting then with a couple of our own properties, refurbished completely, we embarked on a great journey. 

Today the company manages close to 100 properties and growing steadily, mostly in Athens but also in mainland Greece and islands, flats, villas and so on. TopHouzzing  also offers consulting & real estate, design & construction and other professional services in its portfolio.

Hard work and our passion paid off. Our success is clearly stated not only in the many owners that trust us with their properties but even more in the hundreds 5-star reviews from guests from all over the world,  leading us to have a record of 14 consecutive quarters-since the company’s inception- SuperHost status on nocarz!

We are Maria & Alex, the founders, both engineers. So we were already working together in the design & construction sector, so we  dealt with properties all the time. We are both into details, both love doing something right from scratch.

While we were traveling to new places and meeting old friends / making new ones, we felt what a rental should feel like, what it should offer guests like ourselves. Lots were missing, especially the simple little things that makes a visitor feel right at home -away from home. We then decided to start a rentals & real estate management company. It was July 2015 and we named it TopHouzzing Properties - the mission was simply to offer truly top accommodation to our guests. Starting then with a couple of our own properties, refurbished completely, we embarked on a great journey. 

Today the company manages close to 100 properties and growing steadily, mostly in Athens but also in mainland Greece and islands, flats, villas and so on. TopHouzzing  also offers consulting & real estate, design & construction and other professional services in its portfolio.

Hard work and our passion paid off. Our success is clearly stated not only in the many owners that trust us with their properties but even more in the hundreds 5-star reviews from guests from all over the world,  leading us to have a record of 14 consecutive quarters-since the company’s inception- SuperHost status on nocarz!

While we were traveling to new places and meeting old friends / making new ones, we felt what a rental should feel like, what it should offer guests like ourselves. Lots were missing, especially the simple little things that makes a visitor feel right at home -away from home. We then decided to start a rentals & real estate management company. It was July 2015 and we named it TopHouzzing Properties - the mission was simply to offer truly top accommodation to our guests. Starting then with a couple of our own properties, refurbished completely, we embarked on a great journey. 

Today the company manages close to 100 properties and growing steadily, mostly in Athens but also in mainland Greece and islands, flats, villas and so on. TopHouzzing  also offers consulting & real estate, design & construction and other professional services in its portfolio.

Hard work and our passion paid off. Our success is clearly stated not only in the many owners that trust us with their properties but even more in the hundreds 5-star reviews from guests from all over the world,  leading us to have a record of 14 consecutive quarters-since the company’s inception- SuperHost status on nocarz!

We take very good care of our guests and so do we with owners. You see, we both think as guests & owners ourselves. We are waiting anxiously to host you or to manage your property, in both cases you are in good hands with us.",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/06b4721e-c4e0-468b-a4c5-5e7db1c12faa.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/06b4721e-c4e0-468b-a4c5-5e7db1c12faa.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Kolonaki,37,81,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Athina, Greece",ΑΚΡΟΠΟΛΗ,,37.96829,23.72411,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,4,2.0,2 baths,2,2,"[""Dishes and silverware"", ""Washer"", ""TV"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Essentials"", ""Heating"", ""Self check-in"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Lockbox"", ""Hangers"", ""Dryer"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""High chair"", ""Crib"", ""Hot water"", ""Oven"", ""Stove"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Iron"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Fireplace guards"", ""Bed linens"", ""Window guards"", ""Shampoo"", ""Bathtub"", ""Dishwasher"", ""First aid kit"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Kitchen"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Elevator"", ""Wifi"", ""Coffee maker""]",$125.00,2,180,2,2,180,1125,2.0,1060.9,,t,23,53,83,353,2024-12-25,311,54,2,2017-05-23,2024-12-04,4.84,4.89,4.71,4.92,4.92,4.97,4.84,00001367346,t,29,29,0,0,3.36

I am Alexandros, an ex-financier who turned into an entrepreneur.

I grew up in Athens, Greece, an awesome and vibrant city, where I studied Civil Engineering at NTUA. I was always keen on music, a passion which I flipped into DJing, yeap!!! Following my graduation I wanted to see the world and study abroad, so I attended Columbia University in NYC for my second Masters degree. The 2008 crash sent me directly to Germany where I started my career in banking.

After some years in corporate environments I decided to follow my real love, which is creating things from scratch, so I quit my job and alongside with my brother, George, we began a hospitality start-up.
